Help me explore and shape a product idea: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps inspired by *David Pereira's Untrapping Product Teams*:

1. Frame the **problem** clearly. What situation triggered this idea? What’s broken or inefficient?
2. Identify the **desired outcome**. What change in behavior or impact do we want to see?
3. Define **who** is affected. Use personas or real users. Include pains, gains, and Jobs-To-Be-Done.
4. Challenge assumptions. What do we believe that might not be true? What would invalidate this idea?
5. Map possible **solutions**—focus on the problem first, not features.
6. Pick a direction and write a one-pager including:
   - Problem framing  
   - Desired outcome  
   - Who is affected  
   - Key assumptions  
   - Product concept(s)  
   - Risks and unknowns

Pause for review before anything is built. The goal here is clarity, not delivery.
