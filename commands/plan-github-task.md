Please analyze and make a plan for the GitHub task: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Understand the problem. Read relevant files or URLs. Use subagents to verify or investigate specific questions. Do not write code yet
3. Think hard and draft a production-grade solution plan
4. Create a file in mgmt/ with the plan
5. Wait for my approval of the plan before proceeding
6. Once approved, open a draft PR with the plan

Use the GitHub CLI (gh) for all GitHub actions.
